**REPU** is a semi-decentralized non-transferable token intended to be used as a 
reputation system on Edgeware. The **REPU** token can only be issued and burned by
trusted entities that follow the agreed upon standards (hence the term 
semi-decentralized).

A reputation token like **REPU** has many use cases in community governed chains and
blockchain communities in general. For forums and governance platforms like
Commonwealth it can be used to reward users who contribute to the growth of the 
community as well as a means to moderate and prevent trolling. Reputation in chain 
based P2P lending platforms allows lenders to mitigate risk by giving them a measure
of "trustworthiness".

The token has a controlling owner which ideally should be a democratically elected council
such as the Edgeware Council. This owner is able to add entities and has number of other privileges.
A system where there is no controlling owner is also possible.
